# Setting up Apache, PHP and Motion

Allow WinSCP to login as root to make file access easier:

>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Remove the # and change:

>PermitRootLogin yes

After activating the camera in raspi-config, test the camera

>raspistill -o cam.jpg

# Install Apache and PHP7.0

>sudo apt-get install apache2 php7.0 libapache2-mod-php

# Install Motion and Dependencies

>sudo apt-get install motion

>sudo apt-get install libjpeg62

# Activate the official driver for the camera.

>sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

# Tell the Pi to activate the driver after any reboot

>sudo nano /etc/modules

at the end of the file, add this line :

>bcm2835-v4l2

# Set Camera Server as a daemon (background process) and start it automatically

>sudo nano /etc/default/motion

in this file, search for **start_motion_daemon** and activate it

>start_motion_daemon=yes

# Copy the motion.conf file into /etc/motion/

Notable changes from the default file:

>Daemon = OFF to ON

>webcam_localhost = ON to OFF

>stream_localhost ON to OFF

>webcontrol_port 8082

**careful!** don't set the stream port the same as the web control port

Now restart the motion service, start motion and see if you can see the webpage

>sudo service motion restart

>sudo motion

>http://IP_address:8081

At this point, if you cannot see the page, or if sudo motion fails, try and reinstall motion

>sudo apt-get install motion

# Set motion permissions to log and pid folders

>sudo chown -R root:motion /var/log

>sudo chown -R root:motion /var/run

If motion isnâ€™t starting properly when rebooting, add

>sudo motion

to

>sudo nano /etc/rc.local
